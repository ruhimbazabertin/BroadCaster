        <strong>    Corruption is a huge bane to Africa’s development. African countries must develop novel and  localized solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of Broadcaster. Broadcaster  enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities  and the general public. Users can also report on things that need government intervention.</strong>
